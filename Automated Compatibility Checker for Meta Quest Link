## Introduction  
Meta Quest users often face compatibility issues when connecting their headsets to PCs via Link Cable or Air Link. The current official documentation provides a limited list of supported hardware, which can be incomplete and unclear. This proposal aims to create an automated compatibility checker within the Meta PC app that evaluates the user's system and provides real-time feedback on component compatibility, recommendations, and potential upgrade options.

## Problem Statement  
- The current hardware compatibility list does not cover all possible CPU and GPU models.  
- Users often have to search manually to determine if their system meets Meta Quest requirements.  
- A streamlined solution within the app would significantly improve usability and user experience.  

## Proposed Solution  
### Automated System Scan  
- The Meta PC app should automatically detect the user's CPU, GPU, RAM, and other key components.  
- The app will compare detected components against an updated compatibility database.  
- The user will receive a dynamic report stating whether their system is fully compatible, partially compatible, or incompatible.  

### Upgrade Recommendations  
- If certain components do not meet the requirements, the app should suggest upgrade options.  
- Users could be redirected to Metaâ€™s official store or partnered retailers (e.g., Amazon) for purchasing compatible hardware.  
- Potential for Meta to create pre-configured PC bundles optimized for Quest usage.  

## Benefits  
- **User Convenience**: No need for manual checks; all compatibility information is presented instantly.  
- **Improved Transparency**: Clear upgrade paths to improve VR experience.  
- **Potential Revenue Stream**: Meta could leverage affiliate partnerships for hardware sales.  

## Implementation Considerations  
- Collaboration with hardware manufacturers for accurate compatibility data.  
- Regular updates to the compatibility database.  
- Privacy-focused design to ensure user data is handled securely.  

## Conclusion  
This automated compatibility checker would enhance the Meta Quest experience by eliminating uncertainty and streamlining the setup process. Meta could significantly improve user satisfaction while opening new opportunities for hardware sales.
